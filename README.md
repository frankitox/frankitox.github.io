#### Directory structure.

- `_includes` partials parts of a page,
which can be included in throughout our
site.
- `_layouts` partials that can be use as
baseline for a page.
- `_posts` contains our blogposts, usually
written in markdown.
- `_site` is where all the files are
*compiled*.

For other files in root or other folder
that don't have a YAML front matterÂ¹,
you'll get them copied to your `_site`
folder when you compile. If the file has a
YAML, it will be transformed by Jekyll.

[1] YAML front matter is just a fancy word
for the upper YAML data in a layout enclosed
in `---`.

#### Liquid and the site variable.
In the templates you can use
[liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)
and you have access to your `_config.yml`
through the use of the `site` variable.

#### Importing CSS/JS
You'll import a CSS/JS file with the good ol'
`site.base_url`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/css/main.css">
```

#### Importing from \_include folder.
You can import any file from `_include` in
your layouts with

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
{% include head.html %}
<body>
...
```

#### Extending layouts
If you want the layout to be extensible, you
have the `content` placeholder:

```html
<div class="content-container">
  {{ content }}
</div>
```

Then, in a *child* layout or a final page, you
can use YAML front matter to refer to the
layout (without the file extension):

```html
---
layout: default
---
<header>
...
</header>
```

This *child* can also define `content` in
itself, so you can nest as many layouts as
you want. This is a linear nesting. Maybe
there's another type of declaration to allow
more flexibility?

#### YAML front matter
There a couple of special front matter
variables, these are: `layout`, `permalink`
to specify a different URL for a post and
`published` which can be set to false to
avoid post publication.
When building a page, joining all the
partials, you also cram all YAML variables
together in the `page` variable.

Note that a variable defined in a contained
partial will also be available at the upper
most partial. Which is kind of weird.

# Kiko Plus Theme

![image](/images/image.png)

You can see live demo [here](https://aweekj.github.io/Kiko-plus)

This theme is inspired by [Kiko](http://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko) theme, powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

## Features

- Disqus comment system
- Google analytics
- Pagination support
- Custom tags
- SEO support


## Installation

#### Method 1: new master's repository (The Best)

1. First [fork](https://github.com/AWEEKJ/Kiko-plus/fork) it.
2. Change your forked repository name _Kiko-plus_ to __USERNAME.github.io__ where
   __USERNAME__ is your github user name.
3. Access your new blog via [https://username.github.io](https://username.github.io).
4. [See configuration](#configuration).

#### Method 2: gh-pages in existing repository

1. Create a new branch called _gh-pages_ in the repository where you want to add a template [managing branches](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/).
2. From command line run `git clone https://github.com/AWEEKJ/Kiko-plus.git` - this will clone _Kiko-plus_ template to your computer.
3. Create new branch `git checkout -b gh-pages` where _gh-pages_ will be your branch name.
4. Add remote, which is your repo from the first step, to your new branch `git remote add gh-pages https://github.com/<yourName>/<yourMaster>/gh-pages`. _yourName_ is your account name and _yourMaster_ is your repository.
5. Push new branch to remote `git push gh-pages`.
6. Update `_config.yml` file by changing `baseurl: "<branchName>"` _branchName_ is your branch name where _gh-pages_ resides. See [configuration](#configuration).

#### Method 3: run it locally

1. Download [zip](https://github.com/AWEEKJ/Kiko-plus/archive/master.zip) or clone it `git clone https://github.com/AWEEKJ/Kiko-plus`.
2. Go inside folder and run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll s` or `rake preview`. This will build a website which you can access [https://localhost:4000](https://localhost:4000). You need to have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) installed to do this.

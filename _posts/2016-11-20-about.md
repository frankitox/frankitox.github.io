Hello everyone! I'm Franco Biasin, a web
programmer from Argentina. Yep, currently
living there. This is a good ol' school
blog, so my thoughts, code and opinions will
be dumped raw and fresh!

If you enjoy it, there's a RSS feed, a
comments section and of course, if you feel
like there's something you gotta tell me, at
the bottom is the little envelope icon which
may be handy.

Cheers.

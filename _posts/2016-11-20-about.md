Hello everyone! I'm Franco Biasin, a web
programmer from Argentina, yep, currently
living there. This is a good ol' school
blog, so my thoughts, code and opinions will
be dumped raw and fresh!

If you enjoy it, there's a RSS feed, a
comments section and off course, if you feel

This is a little blog to dump
my thoughts, code and opinions
